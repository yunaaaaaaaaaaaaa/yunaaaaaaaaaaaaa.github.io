I made a game about sdg 1, which is no poverty. I wanted to solve this sdg, becasue it is a very common problem all around the world, and is a very big problem. In this game, you have to choose to help a person that has a circle around them. You have to give them a home, food, or money. 

I used ChatGPT, Canva, and Python Streamlit. Something hard was putting all of the red boxes into the right plce. I learned to use tools like ChatGPT more usefully/efficiently to fix my code.
