Hi! My name is Yuna. Me and my friends "researched" on background music AI tools. I will tell you the best tools(In my opinion). First of all, the best background music ai tool is Soundraw. Soundraw is an AI music generator, which creates music that you want. It is created by Daigo Kusunoki, in 2020. You have to pay some money, but you get a lot of free trials. The rating I give is a 4 out of 5. You can pick the length of song, tempo, genre, and mood of the song. After that, Soundraw creates background music that fits what you wanted.
