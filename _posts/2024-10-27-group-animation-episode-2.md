Supa Avocado and Agent Jellybear had to harvest wisdom so that kids could learn. An evil dude released Aphids onto the farm and they had to catch it. They finish catching them all and go to happyland. Everybody thought Harry potato was Voldemort and got into war. Supa Avocado, the character I made, harvests wisdom and catches the Aphids. I did the coding and sound effects/music and helped with making the  background.
